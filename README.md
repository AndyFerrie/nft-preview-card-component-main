## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge was proposed by my teacher on the Bath Spa University Web Development Course. 

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I struggled a bit with how to add the hover effect on the image but eventually solved it with an absolutely positioned div placed on top. I was also thrown a bit by some standard margins so may need to start getting into the habit of using a reset style sheet.

## Acknowledgments

I found it useful to check dimensions using Adobe XD which is something I picked up watching a tutorial by Coder Coder. You can view her channel here:  https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCoderCoder
